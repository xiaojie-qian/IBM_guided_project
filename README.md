## Project I: Getting Started with Rstudio
### Learning Objectives
- Install R and RStudio on your desktop, or use the new cloud-based solution that allows anyone to learn R, directly from your browser.
- Know the 10 most important things that 99% of R programmers should know about the RStudio IDE Interface.
- Be able to explain what R packages are, how to install and load them, from CRAN and Github, into the R session, and create interactive HTML widgets.
## Project II: Mastering data analysis with Pandas
### Learning Objectives
This Guided Project is divided into 4 parts:
- Project Overview: This introductory reading material.
- Hands-on Project: The hands on project
- Graded Quiz: The final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the project successfully.
## Project III: Mining Quality Prediction Using Machine & Deep Learning
### Learning Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:
- Understand the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.
- Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform data visualization
- Perform exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.
- Train and Evaluate different regression models using Sci-kit Learn library.
- Build and train an Artificial Neural Network to perform regression.
- Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.
 - Assess the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.
